Those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: &quot;We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord.&quot; None will grasp the Message except men of understanding.<br/><a class="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/3/137">3:137</a><br/>Many were the Ways of Life that have passed away before you: travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth.<br/><br/><a class="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://quran.com/41/53">41:53</a><br/>Soon will We show them our Signs in the (furthest) regions (of the earth), and in their own souls, until it becomes manifest to them that this is the Truth.
